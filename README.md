# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the following terms:
* object, a part the model is built from.
* class,a part objects are made from.
* instance, particular object.
* method,we can communicate with objects by invoking one or multiple methods on them.
* signature, the method name and the parameter types of a method.
* parameter,additional values that some methods require or may require.
* type,something that defines what values a parameter can take.
* state,the set of values stored in fields
* source code, of a class determines the structure and behavior of each of the
   objects of that class .
* return value, it is used by methods to return information about an object.
* compiler, program that takes the code written and translate it into machine
  language for the machine to understand.

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 int
* "hello" string
* 101 int
* -1 int
* true boolean
* "33" string
* 3.1415 float/double

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
I would add code to where the object circle is.
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
public void send(string R)
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
public int average(int 1,int 2)
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
it's a class. The object inside the book is Data Type.
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
an object can be referenced from many classes as long as it's imported
